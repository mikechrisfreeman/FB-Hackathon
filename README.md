## Felicity (or Feedback engagement layer to inform composer of internal typing, yeah?)

Felcity is a project aiming to provide journalists with inline, crowd-sourced feedback for articles they publish on the web.

It consists of three modules:

### Chrome Extension
The chrome extension, when installed, provides a popup when a user highlights a section of an article belonging to a domain (or a specific page) that a journalist has requested feedback on.  The popup provides the user the opportunity to provide feedback, in the form of a comment, on the highlighted section.

### API
The API is used by the chrome extension to post the user's feedback to the service for review by the article's author.
